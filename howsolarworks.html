<h3>Solar Panels</h3>
<p>
The term solar panel is used colloquially for a photo-voltaic (PV) module.
A PV module is an assembly of photo-voltaic cells mounted in a framework for installation. Photo-voltaic cells use sunlight as a source of energy and generate direct current electricity. A collection of PV modules is called a PV Panel, and a system of Panels is an Array. 
Arrays of a photovoltaic system supply solar electricity to electrical equipment.

<h3>Charger Controller</h3>
<p>
Think of a solar charge controller as a regulator. It delivers power from the PV array to system loads and the battery bank. When the battery bank is nearly full, the controller will taper off the charging current to maintain the required voltage to fully charge the battery and keep it topped off. 
By being able to regulate the voltage, the solar controller protects the battery.

<h3>Battery System</h3>
<p>Solar batteries work by storing energy produced by your solar panels for later use. In some cases, solar batteries have their own inverter and offer integrated energy conversion. The higher your battery's capacity, the more solar energy it can store.
When you install a solar battery as part of your solar panel system, you are able to store excess solar electricity at your home instead of sending it back to the grid. 
If your solar panels are producing more electricity than you need, the excess energy goes towards charging the battery.

<article class="DC">	
<h3>DC Power</h3>
<p>
Direct current, developed by Thomas Edison and the standard of America’s early foray into the world of electricity, involves the use of current that runs in a single direction. 
The consistent and constant voltage of DC power supplies electronics that use a battery, such as your mobile device or smartphone. Like the battery powering your kid’s remote control car, the smooth, steady electrical current of DC power always flows in the same direction, between positive and negative terminals.

<article class="inverter">	
<h3>Inverter</h3>
<p>
A solar inverter or PV inverter, is a type of electrical converter which converts the variable direct current (DC) output of a photovoltaic (PV) solar panel into a utility frequency alternating current (AC) that can be fed into a commercial electrical grid or used by a local, off-grid electrical network.

<article class="AC">	
<h3>AC Power</h3>
<p>
Alternating current (AC) power is the standard electricity format that comes out of outlets. The name comes from the waveform the current takes. To understand the composition of the AC wave, you need to understand that electrical currents come from a flow of electrons. As the electrons in an AC wave move, they can move in a positive direction, which corresponds to the upward part of the sinusoidal wave created by the current. 
When the electrons have a negative flow, the wave drops down.
